# Cobaka

Cobaka "monitors" your dogs noise (especially the barking) when your not at home. It's a simple noise detection tool for Windows. It uses the **standard audio capture device** to listen to room.

If a special treshold is reached it starts a new recording (wav) for some seconds and saves it to a file. You could adjust the **treshold** (0.01 - 0.99), the **duration of each record** (in seconds) and the **destination directory**.
